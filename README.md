A game to test your memory and reaction time.

There are 4 buttons of different colors. They will brighten up in some order. All you have to do is press the buttons in the same order as they were brighten up. The number of steps will increase at each level. You lose as soon as you press the buttons in some other order. Try to reach more and more higher level.

So go on and enjoy this challenging game. Try to beat my personal best of level 16 ;)
